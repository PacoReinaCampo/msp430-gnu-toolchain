MSP430-GCC 8.3.1.25 Release Notes
---
GCC
* Added latest GCC 8.3 patches.
  + For the full list of improvements to optimizations, compiler messages, new
    options and more, visit https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/
* Added support for indirect autoincrement addressing.
  + GCC will now generate instructions using this addressing mode where
    appropriate.
  + This addressing mode is supported by MSP430 for the source operand only.
* MSP430 extended instructions are no longer used to manipulate variables
  marked with the "lower" or "noinit" attributes.
  + GCC assumes variables with these attribute are always in the lower memory
    region, below address 0x10000.
  + This can reduce code size and improve performance when used with
    -mdata-region={upper,either,none}.
* Fixed MOVA instructions being generated in the indexed addressing mode for
  indexes larger than 16-bits.
* General code generation improvements:
  + Make better use of RLAM and RRAM where possible.
  + Reduce code size when manipulating pointers in the large memory model.
  + Use mspabi library functions to perform widening 16-bit multiplication.
* Allow variables marked with the persistent attribute to be initialized to 0.
* Fixed occasional incorrect execution of CRT library code when running programs
  built with both -fexceptions and -mlarge.
* Fixed hardware multiply instructions being generated to perform widening
  multiplication at -O3, when a device specified with -mmcu= has no hardware
  multiply support.

Binutils
* No changes.

Newlib (C Library)
* Fixed debugging information for the exit() library function.
  + When debugging a program in CCS and reaching exit(), previously there was no
    debugging information displayed. Now the call frame and name of the function
    are shown.

GDB
* No changes.
